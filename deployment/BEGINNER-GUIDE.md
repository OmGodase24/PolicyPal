# üéì Complete Beginner's Guide to Deploying PolicyPal

**Never deployed a website before? No problem!** This guide assumes zero deployment experience and walks you through every single step.

## üìö What You'll Learn

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ Your website live on the internet
- ‚úÖ A professional URL people can visit
- ‚úÖ A backend API handling requests
- ‚úÖ An AI service processing documents
- ‚úÖ A database storing user data
- ‚úÖ All running for **FREE**!

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours (first time)

---

## ü§î What is "Deployment"?

**Deployment** = Making your website accessible on the internet

Right now, your app only works on your computer (`localhost:4200`). After deployment, anyone in the world can access it via a URL like `https://policypal.com`.

### Why Multiple Services?

Your app has 3 parts:
1. **Frontend** (Angular) - What users see (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
2. **Backend** (NestJS) - Handles business logic, authentication, database
3. **AI Service** (Python) - Processes PDFs and AI chat

Each part needs to be deployed separately (but they work together).

## üöÄ Part 2: Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

---

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

### Why?
Deployment platforms need to access your code. GitHub stores it in the cloud.

### Instructions:

#### 1.1 Create a GitHub Account
1. Go to https://github.com/signup
2. Enter your email
3. Create a password (strong one!)
4. Choose a username (lowercase, no spaces)
5. Complete the puzzle verification
6. Check your email and verify

#### 1.2 Install Git (if not installed)
**Windows:**
- Download from https://git-scm.com/download/win
- Run installer (keep all default settings)
- Restart your computer

**Check if installed:**
```powershell
git --version
# Should show: git version 2.x.x
```

#### 1.3 Configure Git (First Time Only)
```powershell
# Set your name (use your real name)
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email (use your GitHub email)
git config --global user.email "your-email@gmail.com"

# Verify
git config --list
```

#### 1.4 Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `PolicyPal` (or your preferred name)
3. **Description:** "Full-stack policy management application"
4. **Public** (keep selected - it's free)
5. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (you already have code)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

You'll see a page with instructions - **keep this page open!**

#### 1.5 Push Your Code

Open **PowerShell** in your project folder:
```powershell
# Navigate to your project
cd "C:\Users\om godase\Desktop\PolicyProject"

# Check if Git is already initialized
git status
# If error "not a git repository", run:
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit (save) all files
git commit -m "Initial commit for deployment"

# Connect to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PolicyPal.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**You'll be prompted to login:**
- Modern Git: Opens browser to authenticate
- Older Git: Enter username + password (or Personal Access Token)

**‚úÖ Success Check:** Go to `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PolicyPal` - you should see your code!

**‚ùå Common Errors:**

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| `fatal: not a git repository` | Run `git init` first |
| `fatal: remote origin already exists` | Run `git remote remove origin` then try again |
| `Authentication failed` | Use Personal Access Token instead of password ([guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)) |
| `src refspec main does not exist` | Run `git branch -M main` before pushing |

---

## Step 2: Setup MongoDB Atlas (Database)

### Why?
Your app needs to store data (users, policies, documents). MongoDB Atlas is a free cloud database.

### Instructions:

#### 2.1 Create Account
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register
2. **Sign up method:** Choose "Google" (easiest) or email
3. Complete verification
4. You'll see a welcome screen

#### 2.2 Answer Questions
MongoDB will ask about your use case:
- **What are you building?** Select "I'm learning MongoDB"
- **What do you plan to use?** Check "Cloud database"
- **What is your goal?** Select "Build a new application"
- Click **"Finish"**

#### 2.3 Create FREE Cluster
1. You'll see "Deploy a cloud database" page
2. Click **"Create"** under **M0 (FREE)**
3. **Cloud Provider:** Keep "AWS" selected
4. **Region:** Choose closest to your users:
   - USA: `us-east-1 (N. Virginia)` or `us-west-2 (Oregon)`
   - Europe: `eu-west-1 (Ireland)`
   - Asia: `ap-south-1 (Mumbai)` or `ap-southeast-1 (Singapore)`
5. **Cluster Name:** Keep default or change to `PolicyPal-Cluster`
6. Click **"Create Cluster"** (wait 3-5 minutes)

**You'll see a loading screen** - this is normal!

#### 2.4 Security Setup

**Step A: Create Database User**

You'll see "Security Quickstart" screen:

1. **Authentication Method:** "Username and Password" (selected by default)
2. **Username:** Enter `policypal_user` (or any name you like)
3. **Password:** 
   - Click **"Autogenerate Secure Password"**
   - **IMPORTANT:** Click "Copy" and save it somewhere safe!
   - You'll need this password later!
4. Click **"Create User"**

**Step B: Setup Network Access**

1. **Where would you like to connect from?** 
2. Select **"My Local Environment"**
3. Click **"Add My Current IP Address"**
4. **ALSO** click **"Add a Different IP Address"**:
   - IP Address: `0.0.0.0/0`
   - Description: "Allow from anywhere (for deployment)"
5. Click **"Add Entry"**
6. Click **"Finish and Close"**

**Why `0.0.0.0/0`?** This allows your deployed services (Railway, Render) to connect. For production, you'd whitelist specific IPs, but this works for now.

#### 2.5 Get Connection String

1. You'll see your cluster dashboard
2. Click **"Connect"** button (big green button)
3. Choose **"Connect your application"**
4. **Driver:** Node.js
5. **Version:** 4.1 or later
6. You'll see a connection string like:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://policypal_user:<password>@policypal-cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```
7. **Copy this string**
8. **Replace `<password>`** with your actual password (from Step 2.4)
9. **Add database name** by inserting `/policypal` before the `?`:
   ```
   mongodb+srv://policypal_user:YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD@policypal-cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/policypal?retryWrites=true&w=majority
   ```

**‚úÖ Save this final connection string!** You'll need it multiple times.

**Example of what it should look like:**
```
mongodb+srv://policypal_user:aB3$xYz9@policypal-cluster.abc12.mongodb.net/policypal?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** If your password contains special characters like `@`, `#`, `$`, you need to URL-encode them:
- `@` becomes `%40`
- `#` becomes `%23`
- `$` becomes `%24`

**‚ùå Common Errors:**

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Check password is correct and URL-encoded |
| "Connection refused" | Check Network Access allows `0.0.0.0/0` |
| "Could not connect" | Wait 5 minutes after creating cluster |

## Step 3: Setup Upstash Redis (Cache)

### Why?
Redis stores temporary data for fast access (sessions, cache). Makes your app faster!

### Instructions:

#### 3.1 Create Account
1. Go to https://upstash.com/
2. Click **"Sign Up"** (top right)
3. **Sign up with GitHub** (easiest - uses your GitHub account)
4. Authorize Upstash to access your GitHub
5. You'll be redirected to Upstash console

#### 3.2 Create Redis Database
1. You'll see "Create Your First Database" screen
2. Click **"Create Database"** button
3. Fill in details:
   - **Name:** `policypal-redis`
   - **Type:** **Regional** (free option)
   - **Region:** Choose same as your MongoDB region
     - Example: If MongoDB is in `us-east-1`, choose `us-east-1` here too
   - **TLS:** Keep enabled
   - **Eviction:** No eviction
4. Click **"Create"**

**Wait 10-20 seconds** for creation.

#### 3.3 Get Redis Credentials

You'll see your database dashboard with connection details:

1. Scroll to **"REST API"** section
2. **Copy these two values:**
   - **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL:** 
     - Looks like: `https://us1-some-string.upstash.io`
   - **UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN:**
     - Looks like: `AYAAbGF...` (long string)

**‚úÖ Save both values!** You'll need them for backend deployment.

**Alternative (if your backend uses traditional Redis client):**
- Scroll to **"Redis Connect"** section
- Copy **"REDIS_URL"**:
  - Looks like: `redis://default:password@endpoint.upstash.io:port`

**Most likely, you'll use the REST API version.**

   - Click "Save"
   - Go back to Railway and refresh
5. Click on **`PolicyPal`** repository

#### 4.3 Configure Backend Service

Railway will try to auto-detect your services:

1. If it shows multiple folders, select **`backend`**
2. If it doesn't show anything:
   - Click **"Add a new service"** ‚Üí **"GitHub Repo"**
   - Select your repo
   - Railway will start deploying

**BUT WAIT!** We need to configure it first:

1. Click on the service card (should say "backend" or your repo name)
2. Go to **"Settings"** tab (gear icon)
3. Scroll to **"Service Settings"**:
   - **Service Name:** `backend` (if not already)
4. Scroll to **"Source"**:
   - **Root Directory:** Type `backend` and press Enter
   - This tells Railway your backend code is in the `backend` folder

#### 4.4 Configure Build & Start Commands

Still in Settings:

1. Scroll to **"Build"** section:
   - **Build Command:** `npm ci && npm run build`
   - This installs dependencies and compiles TypeScript

2. Scroll to **"Deploy"** section:
   - **Start Command:** `node dist/main.js`
   - This runs your compiled backend

3. **Auto-Deploy:** Keep ON (deploys automatically on push)

4. Click away or press **"Save"** if you see it

#### 4.5 Add Environment Variables

This is the most important part! Your backend needs these to work.

1. Click on your backend service (if not already there)
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab (second icon from left)
3. Click **"+ New Variable"** button
4. Add each variable below **one by one**:

**Add these variables:**

```env
NODE_ENV=production
```
*Click "+ New Variable" after each*

```env
PORT=8080
```

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://policypal_user:YOUR_PASSWORD@policypal-cluster.xxxxx.mongodb.net/policypal?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```
*(Replace with your actual MongoDB connection string from Step 2.5)*

```env
JWT_SECRET=REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_RANDOM_STRING_MIN_32_CHARACTERS
```
*(Generate a random string - see instructions below)*

**How to generate JWT_SECRET:**
- Open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
-join ((65..90) + (97..122) + (48..57) | Get-Random -Count 32 | % {[char]$_})
```
- Copy the output and use it as `JWT_SECRET`
- Or visit: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/32

Continue adding:

```env
JWT_EXPIRATION=7d
```

```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://us1-your-endpoint.upstash.io
```
*(From Step 3.3)*

```env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=AYAAbGF...your-token
```
*(From Step 3.3)*

```env
FRONTEND_URL=https://temporary-placeholder.vercel.app
```
*(We'll update this after deploying frontend - use any placeholder for now)*

```env
AI_SERVICE_URL=https://temporary-placeholder.onrender.com
```
*(We'll update this after deploying AI service)*

**Email/SMTP Variables (for sending emails):**

If using Gmail:

```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
```

```env
SMTP_PORT=587
```

```env
SMTP_SECURE=false
```

```env
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
```
*(Your actual Gmail address)*

```env
SMTP_PASS=your-app-specific-password
```
*(See instructions below)*

**How to get Gmail App Password:**
1. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
2. Enable "2-Step Verification" (if not already)
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Generate a new password for "Mail" / "Other (Custom name)"
5. Copy the 16-character password (no spaces)
6. Use it as `SMTP_PASS`

```env
EMAIL_FROM=PolicyPal <your-email@gmail.com>
```

```env
MFA_APP_NAME=PolicyPal
```

**Click "Add" after entering each variable.**

#### 4.6 Generate Public URL

1. Still in your backend service, go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Networking"** section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"** button
4. Railway will generate a URL like:
   ```
   https://backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app
   ```
5. **‚úÖ COPY THIS URL!** Save it somewhere - you'll need it multiple times

#### 4.7 Wait for Deployment

1. Click on **"Deployments"** tab (rocket icon)
2. You'll see a deployment in progress
3. Wait 2-5 minutes (first deployment takes longer)
4. **Status should change to:**
   - Building... ‚Üí Success ‚úì
   - Deploying... ‚Üí Success ‚úì

**If deployment fails:**
- Click on the failed deployment
- Read the logs (error messages)
- Common issues:
  - Build command wrong: Check it's `npm ci && npm run build`
  - Start command wrong: Check it's `node dist/main.js`
  - Missing dependencies: Check `backend/package.json` exists

#### 4.8 Test Your Backend

Open a new browser tab and visit:
```
https://your-backend-url.railway.app/health
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-20T..."}
```

**If you see this, SUCCESS! ‚úÖ**

**If you see an error:**
- 502 Bad Gateway: Backend crashed - check logs in Railway
- 404 Not Found: Health endpoint doesn't exist - check your code
- Connection timeout: Still starting up - wait 1 minute and try again

## Step 6: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

### Why?
Your frontend is what users see. Vercel is the best (and free!) platform for Angular/React/Next.js apps.

### Instructions:

#### 6.1 Update Environment File

**IMPORTANT:** Before deploying, update your production URLs:

1. Open `frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts` in your code editor
2. Update these values:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app/api',
  socketUrl: 'https://backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app',
  frontendUrl: 'https://temporary-placeholder.vercel.app', // We'll update this after deployment
  aiServiceUrl: 'https://policypal-ai-service.onrender.com',
  uploadUrl: 'https://backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app/api/upload',
  websocketUrl: 'wss://backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app', // Note: wss:// not https://
};
```

**Replace:**
- `backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app` with your Railway backend URL (from Step 4.6)
- `policypal-ai-service.onrender.com` with your Render AI service URL (from Step 5.6)

3. **Save the file**
4. **Commit and push to GitHub:**

```powershell
git add frontend/src/environments/environment.prod.ts
git commit -m "Update production URLs"
git push origin main
```

#### 6.2 Create Vercel Account
1. Go to https://vercel.com/signup

4. You'll be redirected to Vercel dashboard

#### 6.3 Import Project
1. Click **"Add New..."** button (top right)
2. Select **"Project"**
3. You'll see "Import Git Repository" page
4. Find your **`PolicyPal`** repository
5. Click **"Import"**

**If you don't see your repository:**
- Click **"Adjust GitHub App Permissions"**
- Grant access to `PolicyPal`
- Go back and refresh

#### 6.4 Configure Project

**Framework Preset:**
- Vercel should auto-detect "Angular"
- If not, select "Angular" from dropdown

**Root Directory:**
- Click **"Edit"** next to "Root Directory"
- Select `frontend` folder
- Click "Continue"

**Build and Output Settings:**
Click to expand if not already visible:

- **Build Command:** `npm run build` (keep default)
  - Or use: `ng build --configuration production`
- **Output Directory:** `dist/frontend/browser`
  - **IMPORTANT:** This path depends on your Angular version
  - Check your local `frontend/dist/` folder after running `npm run build`
  - Common paths:
    - Angular 17+: `dist/frontend/browser`
    - Angular 16: `dist/frontend`
    - Custom: Check `angular.json` ‚Üí `projects.yourapp.architect.build.options.outputPath`
- **Install Command:** `npm install` (keep default)

**Environment Variables (Optional):**
- For now, skip this section
- We already updated `environment.prod.ts`

#### 6.5 Deploy

1. Review all settings
2. Click **"Deploy"** button
3. Vercel starts building
4. You'll see build logs in real-time
5. **Wait 3-5 minutes** for first deployment

**Build stages:**

#### 6.6 Get Your Live URL

Once deployment succeeds:

1. You'll see a **"Congratulations"** screen with confetti üéâ
2. Your live URL will be shown:
   ```
   https://policy-pal-abc123xyz.vercel.app
   ```
3. Click **"Visit"** to open your live site
4. **‚úÖ COPY THIS URL!** This is your production frontend URL

#### 6.7 Test Your Frontend

1. Open your Vercel URL in browser
2. You should see your PolicyPal login page
3. **Check browser console** (Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
4. Look for errors:
   - ‚ùå CORS errors: Backend CORS not configured (we'll fix next)
   - ‚ùå 404 errors: Wrong API URL in environment file
   - ‚úÖ No errors: Good to proceed!

#### 6.8 Update Backend & AI Service CORS

Now update your backend and AI service to allow requests from your frontend:

**Update Railway Backend:**

1. Go to **Railway** dashboard
2. Click **backend** service

## üé® Part 3: Optional Enhancements

### Add Custom Domain (Optional)

If you own a domain (e.g., `policypal.com`):

#### On Vercel:
1. Go to your project ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Domains**
2. Click **"Add"**
3. Enter your domain: `policypal.com`
4. Follow DNS instructions from Vercel
5. Add DNS records at your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
6. Wait for DNS propagation (5 min - 24 hours)
7. Vercel auto-generates SSL certificate

#### Update Environment URLs:
After custom domain is active, update all URLs to use `policypal.com` instead of `vercel.app` URL.

## üö® Part 4: Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: CORS Error in Browser

**Error in console:**
```
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'https://backend...' from origin 'https://frontend...' 
has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:**
1. Check Railway backend `FRONTEND_URL` variable
2. Must match your Vercel URL EXACTLY (including https://)
3. No trailing slash
4. Update and wait for redeploy

---

### Problem: Cannot Connect to Database

**Error:**
```
MongooseError: connection refused
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check MongoDB Atlas Network Access allows `0.0.0.0/0`
2. Verify connection string password is correct
3. Special characters in password must be URL-encoded:
   - `@` ‚Üí `%40`
   - `#` ‚Üí `%23`
   - `$` ‚Üí `%24`
4. Test connection string locally first

---

### Problem: Railway Build Failed

**Error in logs:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'xyz'
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check `backend/package.json` exists and has all dependencies
2. Build command should be: `npm ci && npm run build`
3. Check root directory is set to `backend`
4. Try clearing build cache: Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Clear Cache

---

### Problem: Vercel Shows 404

**Site shows "404 Not Found"**

**Solutions:**
1. Check output directory path in settings
2. For Angular, add `vercel.json` in `frontend/` folder:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }
  ]
}
```
3. Commit, push, and redeploy

---

### Problem: Render Service Times Out

**Error:**
```
Request timeout / 503 Service Unavailable
```

**Solution:**
- Render free tier sleeps after 15 minutes
- First request takes 30-60 seconds to wake up
- Add a loading message: "Waking up AI service..."
- Or set up a cron job to ping every 14 minutes

---
