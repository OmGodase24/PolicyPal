## üö® Troubleshooting Checks

If something doesn't work:

- [ ] Check all URLs have `https://` (not `http://`)
- [ ] Check no trailing slashes on URLs (or consistent usage)
- [ ] Check MongoDB connection string password (special chars URL-encoded)
- [ ] Check Railway backend logs for errors
- [ ] Check Render AI service logs for errors
- [ ] Check Vercel build logs for errors
- [ ] Check browser console (F12) for frontend errors
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Verify CORS settings match exactly
- [ ] Test each service independently with curl/Postman
- [ ] Check free tier limits not exceeded
- [ ] Wait 1-2 minutes after env var changes (redeploy time)
