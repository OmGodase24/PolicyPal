## 🆘 Common Questions

### Q: How much will this cost?
**A:** $0/month if you stay within free tier limits. All platforms have generous free tiers.

### Q: Do I need a credit card?
**A:** No! All platforms we use have free tiers without requiring a credit card.

### Q: How long does deployment take?
**A:** 1-3 hours depending on experience level.

### Q: Can I use my own domain?
**A:** Yes! After deployment, you can add a custom domain to Vercel (free).

### Q: What if I get stuck?
**A:** Each guide has a troubleshooting section. Check there first!

### Q: Can I deploy just one part (e.g., only frontend)?
**A:** No, you need all three services (frontend, backend, AI) for the app to work.

### Q: Will my app be fast?
**A:** Yes! Free tiers have some limitations (e.g., Render sleeps after 15min inactivity), but overall performance is good for development and small-scale production.

### Q: Can I upgrade later?
**A:** Absolutely! All platforms have paid tiers with more resources. Easy to upgrade when needed.

### Q: Is this secure?
**A:** Yes, when configured properly. All guides include security best practices (HTTPS, CORS, environment variables, etc.).

### Q: Do I need Docker?
**A:** No! All platforms build your code automatically. No Docker required.
